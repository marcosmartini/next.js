title: Static Generation Postpone Error
---

## Why This Error Occurred

When Partial Prerendering (PPR) is enabled, using APIs that opt into Dynamic Rendering like `cookies`, `headers`, or `fetch` (such as with `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0`) will cause Next.js to throw a special error to know which part of the page cannot be statically generated. If you catch this error, we will not be able to generate any static data, and your build will fail.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Ensure that you are not wrapping Next.js APIs that opt into dynamic rendering in a `try/catch` block.
- If you do wrap these APIs in a try/catch, make sure you re-throw the original error so it can be caught by Next.js.
- Alternatively, insert [`unstable_noStore()`](docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_noStore) before the try/catch.
